# 2024_Folding_scales
We will add the analysis code and data to this repository underpinning our paper "Neuro-evolutionary evidence for a universal fractal primate brain shape".
The code may appear already before the data.
We are currently in the process of preparing the data in a anonymised form and investigating most appropriate options for hosting and sharing for the large dataset.
